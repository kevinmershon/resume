# Kevin Mershon

Hello. If you have received this link, it is probably because you are a recruiter who reached out to me about a job description.

* Apologies for the curt response, but I am messaged **several times daily** by recruiters with poor prospects.
* I do not respond to cold calls or emails except with a link to this page.
* This Markdown file **IS** my resume, so please do not ask me for a Word document or PDF.

Who I am
==
My name is Kevin Mershon. I am a Senior Software Engineer with 19 years experience (as of this writing), professionally employed since 2003.

I have owned and managed a software consultancy before, and I have worked in the following industries:
* Oilfield Services / SCADA
* ERP / NetSuite and high-end corporate accounting
* Shipping and Procurement
* E-Commerce
* Healthcare

Currently, I am employed full time (remote) with [Ride
Health](https://www.ridehealth.com/). I am *casually* seeking employment
elsewhere, but always welcome new interesting opportunities.

I am located in San Jose, CA. I am a US Citizen.

What I am looking for
==

If you are want to hire me, the following criteria are what I am looking for:

1. If I am to change jobs, I am looking for a role that will leverage all of my skills instead of any particular one.

    Poor fits include titles like: `Software Engineer` or `Data Engineer`, or are for roles where I will be a developer full time, and not have any engagement with the sales pipeline, business strategy, or product development pipeline.

    Good fits would be titles like `Principal Software Engineer`, `Software Engineering Manager`, or other such roles where I would either be acting as the CTO or working day to day with the person who fills that role.

1. Base salary $250,000 or higher
    * I am less interested in equity offerings than I am regular raises and annual bonuses
1. If I am to be an individual contributor more than 80% of the time, I _immensely prefer_ to work in the [`Clojure` programming language](https://clojure.org/).

    To be very explicit, I have no interest in working in the following technologies:
    * NetSuite or Salesforce
    * Anything Microsoft or .NET
    * Ruby

    I have _limited tolerance for_, but **will not** entertain the idea of doing the following Full Time:
    * Python
    * Java
    * JavaScript / TypeScript / NodeJS / React

1. Please, no coding challenges in the interview process

    * If you want evidence that I am able to code, [here is an index with over 100 hours of me coding live on Twitch.tv](https://github.com/kevinmershon/livestream-highlights#twitch-channel) and here is a [two and a half hour](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1465965304) sample in particular of me coding in Clojure on an open-source project.
    * If this is not sufficient for your company's internal processes, thank you for your interest and best of luck in your search.

1. I am **NOT** interested in working in the following industries:
    * Aerospace and military contracting
    * Insurance and Lending
    * Real Estate

1. If you still wish to get in touch, please send me a LinkedIn message with the word `Algotrading` and that will get my attention.
